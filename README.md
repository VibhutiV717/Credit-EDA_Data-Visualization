# Credit Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing detailed EDA on a credit dataset to uncover patterns, detect outliers, and prepare the data for further modeling.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Objective
To explore the dataset, analyze feature distributions, check for imbalances or correlations, and build data intuition for modeling.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `credit_eda_assignment.ipynb` – Notebook with visualizations and insights
- `README.md` – Project summary
